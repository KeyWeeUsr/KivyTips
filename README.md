In this repository is the code and other stuff from my YouTube video
series
[`KivyTips`](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP19bggXJC48NRifMtZeyNnhDDVrdvujb).

The videos are done mainly in Python 3.5, but I try to make the code
as compatible as possible with Python 2.

### Installation

You'll need two main components:

* [Python(2.7, 3.4+)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Kivy](https://kivy.org/#download) (preferably the latest one)
